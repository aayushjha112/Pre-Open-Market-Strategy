# Pre-Open-Market-Strategy
We input stocks with certain positive and negative news and trade based on the orderbook and % change for pre-market. We place the order few seconds before closing of the session (9:06:40 AM IST) to escape manipulation of orderbook and exit within the 1st minute of market opening
